# Don't Starve Playable Giants

A hacky mod to stomp around as a Deerclops or other unstoppable giant monster! Includes many prefab overrides to allow crushing almost everything (WIP).

Relies on console commands to transform, thus it's recommended to play as Wik. Other characters not tested. See ``NoteworthyNotes.txt`` for a list of commands.

## Compatibility

Tested on Reign of Giants. Hamlet not worked on yet. Vanilla crashes randomly with no crash log (why?). Shipwrecked might be compatible when l get to Hamlet, but l don't own SW.

Likely conflicts with mods that change workable functions of certain prefabs.
