# Don't Starve Playable Giants

A hacky mod to stomp around as a Deerclops or other unstoppable giant monster! Includes many prefab overrides to allow crushing almost everything (WIP).

Built off [Wicked and the Merms](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=336663941) as a base. Relies on console commands to transform and those are placed inside Wicked, thus it's recommended to play as Wicked. Other characters not tested.

See ``NoteworthyNotes.txt`` for a list of commands.

To download the mod folder, GitZip is recommended.

## Compatibility

Tested on Reign of Giants. Hamlet tested to be okay, Shipwrecked untested but may be fine. Vanilla crashes randomly with no crash log (why?).

Likely conflicts with mods that change Workable functions of certain prefabs.
